# openpyxl
read, write Microsoft Excel
my first attempt to use openpyxl.  I used a specific sheet design to capture input, however the data on the page was not suitable to use in a pivot table.  I needed to denormalise the data so I could Pivot on several attributes.  This code read the "user input" sheet and created a "data" sheet that feeds the Pivot table.
I couldn't create the Pivot automatically.
